# What do you wish to accomplish this semester in Data Mining?
### my objective to this semester specific to data mining are as follows: 
- Since *python* is most important language as also told by Adam, *(96% files are on python)* , I will be focussing on upgrading python skills
- **Data Engineering** is an integral part of data science world. Through the data mining course I am eager to learn those skills 
- I am thrilled to know the ***vast applications of data mining*** such as market analysis, lie detection, pattern recognition etc
    - A great deal of data science work is *visualization* as well. So will be expecting some of the Visulization practice as well
